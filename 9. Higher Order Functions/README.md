# Higher Order Functions

1. A function that takes a function in the arguement or returns function is called a ***Higher Order Function*** <br><br>
2. Now when we write area , circumference and diameter functions, we make functions calculating them and most of the logic is same and doesnt follow **DRY** principle **(Dont Repeat Yourself)** , so it follow it , we just pass in radius and the logic in the common function so we are calculating the these things only once rather than making separate functions , *example in hof.js*.<br><br>
3. **Array.Prototype.varibale_name** basically makes the function inside the variable to able to used like a method.
