# Promise

1. A promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
2. It is represented like this -> {data : undefined} and once the promise is resolved -> {data : function_value}
3. *.then()* in the promise.js basically means that when the ***createOrder*** pormise is resolved , then the callback function is called.
